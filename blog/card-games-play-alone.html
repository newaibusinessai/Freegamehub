                <ul>
                    <li>All cards visible—no hidden surprises</li>
                    <li>More strategic than Klondike due to visible information</li>
                    <li>Unique move rules create different solving approach</li>
                    <li>Familiar enough for Klondike players, different enough to feel fresh</li>
                    <li>Rewarding to master</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Strategy Tip:</strong> Use the ability to move any sequence of cards (even non-sequential) to create strategic opportunities not possible in Klondike.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Getting the Most from Solo Card Games</h2>

            <h3>1. Start with the Right Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Don't jump into the hardest variants immediately. Build skills progressively. Start with Klondike, master it, then try more challenging games.</p>

            <h3>2. Learn Basic Strategies</h3>
            <p>A few simple strategies dramatically improve win rates. Read basic strategy guides for your chosen games—it makes them much more enjoyable.</p>

            <h3>3. Use Undo Wisely</h3>
            <p>Undo features are great for learning, but don't over-rely on them. Try to think ahead rather than using trial-and-error constantly.</p>

            <h3>4. Track Your Progress</h3>
            <p>Many online versions track your statistics. Watching your win rate improve over time is motivating and validates your skill development.</p>

            <h3>5. Try Different Variants</h3>
            <p>Don't limit yourself to one game. Exploring different variants keeps things fresh and exercises different cognitive skills.</p>

            <h3>6. Set Personal Challenges</h3>
            <p>Once you're comfortable, add challenges: time yourself, try to win with minimum moves, or aim for winning streaks.</p>

            <h3>7. Take It Seriously (But Not Too Seriously)</h3>
            <p>Approaching games strategically makes them more rewarding, but remember—they're meant to be fun and relaxing. Don't stress over losses!</p>
