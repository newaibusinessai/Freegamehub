            <h1>The History of Solitaire: From Card Tables to Computers</h1>

            <p>Solitaire is one of the world's most played games, with hundreds of millions of people having clicked through countless games on Windows computers alone. But this beloved single-player card game has a rich history stretching back centuries, evolving from aristocratic parlor entertainment to the digital phenomenon we know today.</p>

            <p>This comprehensive timeline explores the fascinating journey of Solitaire—from its mysterious European origins through its popularization in literature, its transformation into digital format, and its explosive growth as Microsoft Windows' most iconic built-in game. Let's shuffle through history and discover how Solitaire became a global pastime.</p>

            <h2>The Early Origins of Solitaire (1700s-1800s)</h2>

            <h3>Where Did Solitaire Begin?</h3>

            <p>The exact origins of Solitaire remain somewhat mysterious, with several theories competing for credibility:</p>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>Theory 1: Scandinavian Origins</h4>
                <p>Some historians believe Solitaire originated in Scandinavia or the Baltic region during the late 1700s. The word "patience" (the British term for Solitaire) may derive from French parlor games, but the gameplay concepts could have northern European roots.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>Theory 2: French Aristocracy</h4>
                <p>The most popular theory places Solitaire's origins in late 18th-century France. The name "Solitaire" itself is French, and early references to the game appear in French literature from this period. It may have been played by French aristocrats as entertainment during the tumultuous revolutionary period.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>Theory 3: German Roots</h4>
                <p>Some card game historians point to Germany as a potential birthplace, noting that many early patience games have German names and rulebooks.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Regardless of precise origins, by the early 1800s, Solitaire had become established as a popular form of entertainment across Europe.</p>

            <h3>Napoleon's Connection (Myth vs. Reality)</h3>

            <div class="fact-box">
                <p><strong>Popular Myth:</strong> Napoleon Bonaparte invented or frequently played Solitaire during his exile on St. Helena (1815-1821).</p>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> While this romantic story is widely repeated, there's no reliable historical evidence that Napoleon played Solitaire. However, the association has persisted in popular culture, and some Solitaire variants are named after him (Napoleon's Patience, Napoleon at St. Helena).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Solitaire Goes Mainstream (1800s)</h2>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1826: First Documented Rules</h4>
                <p>The earliest known rules for Solitaire games appear in a German book of games. This marks the beginning of Solitaire's documentation in print.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1870s: Rising Popularity in England</h4>
                <p>Solitaire (or "Patience" as the British called it) becomes fashionable among the English middle and upper classes. It's seen as a respectable pastime, particularly for women.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1870: First English Language Rules</h4>
                <p>Lady Adelaide Cadogan publishes "Illustrated Games of Patience" in London, the first comprehensive English-language book of Solitaire games. This book catalogs dozens of variants and helps standardize rules.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1890s: Klondike Solitaire Emerges</h4>
                <p>While exact dates are uncertain, the Klondike variant likely emerged during or shortly after the Klondike Gold Rush (1896-1899) in Canada's Yukon Territory. Prospectors and settlers playing cards during long winters may have developed or popularized this variant.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Victorian Era: Solitaire as Respectable Entertainment</h3>

            <p>During the Victorian era, Solitaire served as acceptable entertainment for women and was often played in parlors. Unlike gambling or other card games with negative social connotations, patience games were considered wholesome, intellectually stimulating, and socially appropriate.</p>

            <h2>Early 20th Century: Codification and Expansion</h2>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1907: First Documented Klondike Rules</h4>
                <p>The earliest known written rules for Klondike Solitaire appear in print, establishing the game's basic structure that remains unchanged today.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1913: "The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games"</h4>
                <p>Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith publish comprehensive rulebooks that become standard references, documenting hundreds of Solitaire variants.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1930s-1950s: Mainstream Entertainment</h4>
                <p>Solitaire becomes a common pastime during the Great Depression and World War II. Soldiers play during downtime, families play at home, and the game requires nothing but a deck of cards—perfect for lean times.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Digital Revolution (1960s-1980s)</h2>

            <h3>Solitaire Enters the Computer Age</h3>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1962: First Computer Solitaire</h4>
                <p>The earliest digital version of Solitaire appears on mainframe computers. These text-based versions use character graphics and command-line input, accessible only to computer researchers and university students.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1981: Spider Solitaire Invented</h4>
                <p>While the exact inventor is disputed, Spider Solitaire gains popularity in this era. It will later become one of the most popular Solitaire variants worldwide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1984: Macintosh Solitaire</h4>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1990: Windows 3.0 Includes Solitaire</h4>
                <p><strong>This is the pivotal moment in Solitaire history.</strong> Microsoft includes Solitaire (developed by intern Wes Cherry) in Windows 3.0. The goal? To teach users how to use a mouse through an engaging, familiar game.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Solitaire instantly becomes one of the most played computer games in history. Millions of people who had never touched a computer before learned mouse skills by playing Solitaire at work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="fact-box">
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Wes Cherry, the Microsoft intern who programmed Windows Solitaire, never received royalties for creating one of the most played games in history. He did it as part of his internship work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">

            <div class="timeline-box">

                <p>Microsoft includes FreeCell Solitaire (developed by Jim Horne) alongside Klondike. FreeCell's high solvability rate (nearly every deal is winnable) attracts serious players seeking skill-based challenges.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h4>1998: Windows 98 Adds Spider Solitaire</h4>
                <p>Microsoft includes Spider Solitaire, offering three difficulty levels (1-suit, 2-suit, 4-suit). Spider becomes a favorite among advanced players seeking greater challenge.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Cultural Impact of Microsoft Solitaire</h3>
