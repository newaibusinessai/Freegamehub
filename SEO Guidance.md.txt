Content plan for ranking

1. Keyword Clusters

First, group the 50 keywords into logical “clusters” (themes). Clustering helps with content planning, internal linking, and SEO structure.

Here are 6 clusters aligned with your game types + general topics:

Cluster	Keywords (examples)
Solitaire – General / Broad	solitaire, solitaire online, play solitaire, free solitaire, classic solitaire, online games no download, browser games free
Klondike / Standard Solitaire Variants	klondike solitaire, freecell (well, FreeCell is its own but often grouped), freecell solitaire, classic patience games
Spider & Pyramid Solitaire	spider solitaire, spider solitaire online, pyramid solitaire, free pyramid solitaire
FreeCell / Skill Solitaire	freecell, freecell online, freecell game, freecell solitaire
Minesweeper / Logic Puzzle	minesweeper, minesweeper online, classic minesweeper, free minesweeper, minesweeper game
Mahjong & Matching / Memory Games	mahjong, mahjong solitaire, mahjong online, free mahjong, memory game, memory matching game, matching game online
2. Estimated Search Volume (Approx)

Using public / semi-public data + third-party SEO-research sources, here are rough monthly global search volumes or ranges for some of the key clusters / keywords. (These are estimates — for precise data, run these in a professional tool.)

Keyword / Cluster	Estimated Monthly Search Volume (global / approximate)
Solitaire (broad)	~11 million /mo for "solitaire" according to Semrush data for solitaire.net 
Semrush

Solitaire online	~1,000,000 (Adtargeting gives “solitaire online” ~1 M) 
AdTargeting

Free solitaire	~1,000,000 (same source) 
AdTargeting

Klondike solitaire	~550,000 according to Adtargeting’s free-game keyword list 
AdTargeting

FreeCell	~1,864,200 (Adtargeting’s “freecell”) 
AdTargeting

Spider solitaire	According to Lookkle “spider solitaire” has ~1,000,000 volume. 
lookkle.com

Minesweeper	According to Lookkle, “minesweeper” ~1,220,000. 
lookkle.com

Mahjong	From KeySearch, “mahjong” ~3,350,000 (gaming keyword list) 
KeySearch

Mahjong Solitaire	more niche, possibly a fraction of “mahjong”, but significant search volume in puzzles / games niche — we don’t have a precise public breakdown from free tools.
Memory game	Likely in the lower-hundreds-of-thousands globally; many “memory game” variants + long tail. (Note: I don’t have a strong precise public number.)
3. SEO Difficulty Level (Relative)

Estimating SEO difficulty (“how hard to rank”) without a paid tool is imprecise, but we can make relative judgments based on typical competition in the “online games / browser games” niche.

Here’s a framework + my assumptions:

High difficulty: Very broad, high-volume keywords like “solitaire”, “free games”, “online games” — many established sites compete.

Medium difficulty: Game-variant specific keywords (“klondike solitaire”, “spider solitaire online”, “minesweeper game”) — still competitive, but more niche.

Lower difficulty (relatively): Long-tail or more specific phrases (“online minesweeper no ads”, “free pyramid solitaire no download”, “memory matching game for adults”) — good opportunities for content pages, especially if you build internal backlinks, have domain authority, or produce high-quality content.

Estimated difficulty breakdown:

Cluster	Relative SEO Difficulty
Solitaire – General / Broad	High
Klondike / Standard Variants	Medium-High
Spider & Pyramid	Medium
FreeCell / Skill Solitaire	Medium
Minesweeper / Logic Puzzle	Medium
Mahjong & Memory	Medium (for broad “mahjong”), Lower-Medium for specific “mahjong solitaire” or “memory game” long tails
4. Recommended Pages to Target Keywords

Here’s how you might map content pages on your site to these keyword clusters. (Assuming your site has or can have a structure like: /games/solitaire, /games/minesweeper, /blog/..., etc.)

Page / Content Type	Target Cluster + Keywords
Homepage / Games Hub	General keywords: "solitaire", "browser games free", "online games no download" — this will capture broad interest and funnel to individual game pages.
Solitaire – Variants Page	A page listing all solitaire games on your site (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid). Use headings for each variant: “Klondike Solitaire”, “Spider Solitaire”, etc. Target keywords: "solitaire online", "play solitaire", "free solitaire", "classic solitaire" + variant names.
Klondike Solitaire Page	Dedicated game page for Klondike. Target: "klondike solitaire", "play klondike solitaire online", "free klondike solitaire".
Spider Solitaire Page	Dedicated for Spider. Target: "spider solitaire", "free spider solitaire online", "spider solitaire game".
Pyramid Solitaire Page	Dedicated for Pyramid. Target: "pyramid solitaire", "free pyramid solitaire", "play pyramid solitaire".
FreeCell Page	Dedicated for FreeCell. Target: "freecell", "freecell solitaire", "play freecell online".
Minesweeper Page	Dedicated for Minesweeper. Target: "minesweeper", "minesweeper online", "classic minesweeper", "free minesweeper".
Mahjong / Memory Page	Could be two or one page depending on your site structure:

Mahjong page: "mahjong solitaire", "mahjong online", "free mahjong".

Memory / Matching game page: "memory game online", "matching game", "memory matching game for adults".
| Blog / Content / SEO Articles | Write content pieces / “pillar” / “cornerstone” articles:

“How to play Klondike Solitaire: rules & strategy” — target “play klondike solitaire”

“Minesweeper tips & strategy” — “minesweeper game”, “how to beat minesweeper” (you could add “how to” long tail)

“History of Mahjong Solitaire” — target “mahjong solitaire”, “mahjong online”

“Memory games to boost your brain” — for “memory game online”, “matching game online”


5. Content Plan for Ranking

Here is a content / SEO plan to help you grow organic traffic for your games site, structured around the keyword clusters and recommended pages.



Foundation

Audit & On-Page SEO

Make sure each game page (Solitaire variants, Minesweeper, Mahjong, Memory) is SEO-optimized: meta titles, H1s, page copy, alt text, internal links.

Use the target keywords from the clusters in page headings and descriptive text.

Ensure your site navigation makes it easy to find each game (e.g., a “Games” menu with sub-pages).

Content Creation: Pillar Pages

Write a “Solitaire Variants” pillar page that introduces Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid, with internal links to each variant page.

Create a “Minesweeper Guide” – rules, history, strategy.

Create a “Mahjong Solitaire Guide” – how to play, tile matching strategy.

Write a “Memory Game Benefits” post – cognitive benefits, how to play, variations.

Technical SEO

Ensure your site loads quickly (games + landing pages).

Mobile responsiveness.

Schema markup (if applicable) for pages (e.g., “Game” type schema, though tricky — but at least site meta, headings, etc).



Content Expansion & Internal Linking

Blog / SEO Articles

“Top 10 Solitaire Tips & Strategies” — internal link to Klondike, Spider, FreeCell.

“How to Solve Minesweeper Quickly: Beginner to Expert”

“Why Mahjong Solitaire Is Good for Your Brain”

“5 Memory Games to Play Online for Free”

Long-Tail Keyword Targeting

Use long-tail variations (e.g., “free pyramid solitaire no download”, “online minesweeper no ads”) as subtopics/sections in your blog.

Use FAQs: “How to play FreeCell?”, “Can you win Minesweeper every time?”, etc.

Internal Link Strategy

From blog posts, link to the relevant game pages.

On game pages, link back to the pillar / guide pages.

Use “related games” sections (e.g., on Solitaire variant pages, suggest other solitaire games).



Off-Page SEO & Backlinks

Link Building

Reach out to gaming blogs, puzzle / educational sites, and mental health / brain-training blogs to write guest posts or get links to your guides.

Consider “linkable assets”: your “How to Play / Strategy” guides, “Memory Game Benefits” article, etc.

Partnerships & Community

Partner with niche communities (Reddit r/solitaire, puzzle forums) — write helpful content that links to your site.

Encourage social sharing: embed “play this game” links in blog posts, encourage users to share their best Minesweeper times, etc.

User Engagement

Add user-generated content: e.g., leaderboard, “best times / scores” for Minesweeper or Solitaire. This can drive traffic and engagement.

Include a “Tips from players” section, or a small blog/news section where you occasionally interview power users or share strategies.

Phase 4: Monitoring, Optimization & Iteration (Ongoing)

Track Performance

Use Google Analytics / GA4 or equivalent to track which pages are getting the most traffic.

Use Google Search Console to monitor which keywords you are ranking for, and how your pages perform in SERPs.

Optimize underperforming pages

For pages that aren’t ranking well, refresh content with more keyword-rich subheadings, FAQs, and internal links.

Possibly split or merge pages: if one guide page is too long and broad, break it down; if two pages are thin, combine.

Expand with New Keywords

After 6 months, run a new round of keyword research (using your SEO tool) to discover additional long-tail opportunities (e.g., “freecell strategy”, “mahjong solitaire shapes”, etc).

Add new blog posts or game variants as needed.
