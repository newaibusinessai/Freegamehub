## 🎯 REMAINING OPTIMIZATIONS (OPTIONAL/LOW PRIORITY)

The following items were NOT completed as they are lower priority or require external resources:

### Still Pending:
1. **Image Optimization** - User will provide optimized images
2. **Create Open Graph images** - Requires design tools (Canva, Photopea)
3. **Meta description optimization** - Current descriptions are adequate (130-145 chars); could extend to 150-160 chars for marginal improvement
4. **Improve internal linking anchor text** - Current linking is functional; could be enhanced from generic "Read More" to descriptive anchors
5. **Add breadcrumb navigation (visible)** - BreadcrumbList schema exists, but visible breadcrumbs could improve UX
6. **Social share buttons** - Low priority, minimal SEO impact
